Hi, welcome on my website.

I'm a German mechanical engineering student currently studying in Stockholm, Sweden.
On this blog I will write about the things that I find interesting and the projects I'm working on. This includes books, Linux related stuff, 3D-printing and hiking. Maybe I'll throw some D&D or MTG talk into the mix as well.
