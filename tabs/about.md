Hi, welcome on my website.

I'm a German mechanical engineering student currently studying in Stockholm, Sweden.
On this blog I will write about the things that I find interesting and the projects I'm working on. This includes books, Linux related stuff, 3D-printing and hiking. Maybe I'll throw some D&D or MTG talk into the mix as well.

If you want to get notified when I post something new there is nothing I can do for you since I'm not active on social media. But if you really, really like this blog you can follow me the old fashioned by bookmarking this page.
