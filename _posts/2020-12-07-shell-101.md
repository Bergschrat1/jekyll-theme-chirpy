Sometimes when I talk to people about Linux, they tell me that they have problems with "this black box where you have to type stuff". Most likely they just mean a terminal emulator.

There is this believe that you need to be Hackerman to understand how to use a terminal.

But fear no more! I'm here to tell you that using a terminal is not only extremely easy but can also save you a lot of time.
After reading this post you'll be able to do the most common day-to-day tasks on your computer without having to open some annoying GUI application.

I'll go through the most important commands that you probably need on a daily basis and give you some examples of how to use them.
These commands are available on every Linux distribution and should be available on MacOS devices as well.

# The basics

First of all let's look at the general syntax of a command line program:

```shell
$ command [--option1 --option2] argument
```

Most commands have options that can change the output in some way. Often the options have a abbreviation that is then given with just one `-` sign, e.g `-v` instead of `--verbose`.

Everything that is not an option is an argument. Arguments are separated with spaces.

But what if you want to give a single argument than includes a space? In that case you should wrap the argument into quotation marks:

```shell
$ echo "Hello there!"
```

This command will print `Hello there!` to the command line (without the quotation marks of course).

## `man` (MANual)

Theoretically this is the only command you need. It'll open the documentation for whatever other command you give as input. It is always better to look at the man-page instead of copying a command from the internet. This way you learn to build commands yourself and can be more productive in the future.

```shell
$ man ls
```

You can use this whenever you are not sure what the options for a command are or how to use them. The manual pages often give some examples as well.

The man-pages are opened with the program `less` by default. Here you can scroll up and down with your mousewheel and quit by pressing q.

---

## `ls` (**L**i**s**t)

This command will list all the files and directories of your current directory. If you give it a directory name as input, it will list the content of that directory instead.

Some useful options are:

- `-l` to get a more list-like output with additional information about permissions and modification date
- `-a` to see hidden files

---

## `cd` (**C**hange **D**irectory)

This is the command that you use to move around in your file system. You can give either a relative path (starting with `./`) or an absolute path (starting with `/`) as input and it will take you there.

```shell
$ cd ~/Documents/
```

The `~` is an abbreviation for your home directory. So writing `~/Documents/` is the same as `/home/[username]/Documents/`.

Another trick is to use `cd ../`. This will move you to the directory above your current directory. 

---

## `pwd` (**P**rint **w**orking **d**irectory)

Like the name suggests, this command prints the directory that you are currently working in, e.g. from ~/Documents/uni/ to ~/Documents/ .

---

## `mv` (**M**o**v**e)

Now we get to the actually useful commands. `mv` lets you move files or directories.
It can also be used to rename files. This works because renaming a file is the same as moving it to the same location but with a different file name.

They syntax is very easy:
```shell
$ mv [source] [target]
```

Moving or renaming would look like this:

Moving:
```shell
$ mv ./hello.txt ./test_directory/hello.txt
```

Renaming
```shell
$ mv ./hello.txt ./hello_world.txt
```

---

## `cp` (**C**o**p**y)

Just like the `mv`-command the `cp`-command behaves like you would expect it from other graphical file managers. The syntax is also exactly the same:

```shell
$ cp [source] [target]
```

---

## `mkdir` (**M**a**k**e **dir**ectory)

This command will create a new directory (folder). 

```shell
$ mkdir ./new_directory/
```

Often you want to create multiple nested directories, e.g. `./new/nested/directory/`. If one of the parent directories does not exist, you will get an error because `mkdir` can't find the location of the most nested directory. In that case you need to use the `-p, --parents` flag. This way all the needed subdirectories will get created without creating an error.

```shell
$ mkdir -p ./new/nested/directory/
```

---

## `touch` (Create file)

I'm not exactly sure why this command is called `touch` and not `mkfile` because that is what it's used for most of the time. It's original purpose is to set the modification time of a file to the current time but when the file doesn't exist it will just create an empty file.

```shell
$ touch ./new_file.txt
```

This will create a new empty file called `new_file.txt` in the current directory.

---

## `rm` (**R**e**m**ove)

This command will remove a file or directory.

```shell
rm ./new_file.txt
rm ./new_directory/
```

If you want to remove a directory that contains files or other directories you need to use the -r (recursive) flag.
I urge you to be very, very careful with that command. Sometimes you forget that there are important files in a subdirectory and then there is no way to get them back. If you want to have another layer of protection you could use the -i (interactive) flag. This way you have to confirm each file you delete.

A word of warning: There is a meme on the internet that tells people to write `sudo rm -rf /*` into their terminal. This would delete every single file on your PC, even the system relevant ones. So better don't to this unless you want to install a new system anyway. In that case please contact me, because I would love to hear how the system would react in such a case.
