Since I have already covered the 'geek' part in the name of my website I decided that it's time to write something about the books I'm reading.

# Reading background

A little background on my reading habits:

For the longest part of my life I've been reading classic fantasy books. As a child my favourite books were the *Narnia Chronicles*, *Eragon*, *The Hobbit* and also some German fantasy books like *The Elves* by Bernhard Hennen and *The Dwarves* by Markus Heitz. Most of my stupid ideas as a child I got from adventure books like *Huckleberry Finn*, *Tom Sawyer* and the western fiction books by Karl May.

When I was old enough to understand his humor I got hooked by Terry Pratchett. My favorites are all the Death books, the Witches series (especially Tiffany Aching), the City watch series, the Wizards series and from the non-Discworld books I absolutely loved *Nation*, *Dodger* and the *Nome Trilogy*. Now that I write this I realize that basically **all** Terry Pratchett books are my favorite Terry Pratchett books. :D

While I love fantasy books, they rarely challenged the reader's way of thinking. Instead they create new worlds with new laws of nature and societies. This can be very nice when the reader wants to escape the real world but it can become very boring when the reader wants to learn something about the existing world and society.

That's why last year I started reading some non-fictional books and have been enjoying it since. It is refreshing to get new perspectives on the real world instead of learning about the fictional worlds in fantasy books.

# Thinking, fast and slow

Currently I'm reading the book 'Thinking, fast and slow' from Daniel Kahneman. The author is an psychologist who earned the nobel prize in economy for his work in the field of the behavioral sciences. In this book he summarizes his lives work while his goal is to make it understandable even for layman like me.

Behavioral sciences may not sound appealing to everyone but the author is able to explain his research in a very understandable way and uses many real-life examples to clarify his findings. The topics he describes are still very complex so it helps to make notes while reading this book. That's why I write this blog entry as a reading diary and it will therefore get updated while I continue reading this book.

# Thoughts about thinking

Starting here I will go chronologically through the chapters of the book and write down the things that I find most important and interesting.

## Chapter 1: 'The Characters of the Story'

In this chapter the most important thought of the book is introduced: The two systems of the mind.
The author distinguishes between System 1 and System 2. These are just names for two operational states of the mind. The two systems are responsible for handling different kinds of problems and get engaged whenever the mind feels like one of the systems is required to solve a problem.

It is important to understand that both systems are necessary for a human to operate and none of them is better or worse.

### System 1

The first system is responsible for the "fast thinking" mentioned in the title of the book. This includes most instinctive motoric actions like jumping away from a car or catching a cup that falls down. It also handles  very easy cognitive tasks like calculating the result of "1+1".

System 1 is active most of the time and tries to handle as many tasks as it can. As long as system 1 is active the mind operates in a low energy mode and uses up very few energetic resources.

### System 2

This system takes over control once system 1 thinks that it can't handle a task. This usually happens once a task takes more than a few seconds, like when calculating complicated mathematical problems or playing a game of chess.

The use of system 2 has a significant impact on the energy use of the body, which is why the mind tries to activate this system as little as possible.


## Chapter 2: 'Attention and Effort'

In this chapter the author describes how the mind keeps up effort and distributes it to different tasks. Effort is handled like a limited resource and the mind tries to use it up as little as possible. The author found out that the amount of effort that the mind uses can be measured by measuring pupil dilation. Apparently the pupil gets bigger once the mind activates system 2. This has been proven in many experiments where the participants were looking in a camera while solving mathematical problems. The method was so reliable that the experimenters were able to see exactly when a person started a calculation and also when they gave up because the calculation was too hard.
